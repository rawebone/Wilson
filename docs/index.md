# Wilson Documentation

Wilson is a lightweight web framework designed to provide consistency when
working on RESTful APIs in a concise and quick way. It aims to take the
pain out of working with HTTP and structure your workflow with the smallest
footprint possible (~0.002 of a second, with all optimisations taken advantage
of, in a test application).

The framework doesn't have very many concepts but they've been split out here
for ease of learning.
